Find those 8 and 9 letter words to get the highest scores on [Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) and win yourself that [teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#/media/File:Teapot_(levelled).jpg)!
(You'll still need to be good at the maths bit though...)

Built as a fun little Command Line program while watching Countdown, this could easily be adapted for use in a Countdown style game or a puzzle game. It is built using Python and a large JSON document filled with English words. Feed the program 9 letters and it will
check the list of words and return any that are longer than 3 characters. All well within the 30 second Countdown round time limit ðŸ˜‰.

Enjoy! â˜•
